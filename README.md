# Pacman #
## Code analysis ##


I wrote the code to recreate this game, following Object-Oriented Programming principles. 
The logic is quite straight forward, but still, I think is good to analyse how it works.

I used Canvas, a special HTML element which allows to draw graphics via JavaScript. Canvas is perfect to draw 2d games with ease.
To use Canvas, we declare the html tag, then in the script we get the Canvas element and its context API.
The context is crucial to use Canvas drawing methods.
